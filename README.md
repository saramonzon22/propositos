In this application we are going to develop with Python and Flask. The database I use is Cloud Firestore from Google.

The intention is to make a web page where the user can register and there collect their resolutions for the year 2023.

It has a registration part, a LogIn and LogOut part. Within the profile each user can add new tasks and I am developing a way to delete them.
